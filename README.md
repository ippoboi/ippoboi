# Hi, I'm Dimitar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Design Engineer who bridges the gap between design and development. I believe in creating solutions that are both beautiful and functional.

## What I Do

I design and code websites, mobile apps, and web applications with a **50/50 focus** on both design and development. My approach is user-oriented, data-driven, and grounded in engineering thinking for optimal usability.

### ðŸŽ¨ Design
- UI/UX Design with **Figma**
- User research and market analysis
- Creating intuitive, problem-solving interfaces

### ðŸ’» Development
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, React Native with Expo
- **Backend:** Node.js, NestJS, Python
- Building scalable, performant applications

## My Focus

I'm passionate about building mobile apps that solve real problems. Every project starts with understanding the user's needs and is backed by data to ensure we're building the right solution.

## Let's Connect

I'm open to freelance opportunities and interesting collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you have a project that needs both design thinking and technical execution.
